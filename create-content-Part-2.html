                        The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary.

                        The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.

                        If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages.
